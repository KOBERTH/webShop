# Web Shop
This e-commerce project was inspired by another one found on the Internet. Although itâ€™s not an exact copy, certain references were taken such as colors and the placement of certain elements.

### Note: 
To run this project, you will need to have product data in a local MongoDB database on your PC. Also, you will need to run the pnpm install command to install all dependencies within the frontend directory. For the backend, you will need to install the dependencies or use the virtual environment.

Here are some images of what the web page looks like:

This page still has aspects to improve and enhancements will be added whenever they are achieved and things come to mind to add.

The page has the basic elements of an e-commerce such as product search, shopping cart, existing category selector, product view, etc. Although it does not have a user registration, work is being done to implement this functionality.

All the elements that this page has are functional or at least that is what is expected. I imagine that some optimizations or improvements would be missing but, as mentioned earlier, this will be improving.

Purchases are for testing as Stripe is used for payment but it is still functional as a project. It is a very basic template but useful for understanding concepts and being able to practice them.

It is expected that this page can serve to sell it or something like that, so work is being done on it.

## Installation
To install all the necessary dependencies for this project, run the following command in your terminal:
