# Online Store
This project is a FullStack online store page made with React-TS, FastAPI, and MongoDB.

The project already contains several essential elements for an online store, such as:

- The shopping cart where you can add, remove, update the quantity of each product. It also shows the number of products in it.

- The search function works like a typical search engine, which is used to search for a product and decide whether to add it or not from there.

- The categories section is in the navigation bar.

- It contains a 404 page, and the login page is also implemented. Although the functionality is implemented, some adjustments are still needed for full integration, so this section is not 100% usable at the moment.

- The purchase method is simple. We are using PayPal as an intermediary for payments. There is also a form to indicate name, address, etc., and necessary personal data for the purchase. This is handled as if it were home delivery at the moment.

- The method used to handle the user system at the moment is a creation of a temporary user id, which is saved along with the shopping cart product as if it were the user id.

The main idea is to create a (“new method”) of product view, or do something different from the conventional. So instead of having a separate page for categories, these are on the main page. These are loaded until the category section is 100% visualized on the screen.

At the moment, the page does not have a graphical program to control the database or rather the backend but will soon have it. At the moment, the backend has to be handled manually.

The page is also fully responsive. And although it still lacks a few improvements, it is functional. It should be noted that I am not an expert so the project is not perfect.
